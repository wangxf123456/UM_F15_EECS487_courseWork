1. Mac OSX
2. For task 5, since Catmull-Rom spline does not interpolate between the first two points and the last two points. So when time is between the first two points, I set p0=p1. When time is between the last two points, I set p2=p3. For task 6, it looks like my character's leg is quite far away from its body. But actually it is close enough to its body, it looks like this because I used a texture with transparent color on its border as the body.
3. This is a fantastic project assignment. But it does not cover on the course materials after splines. I think it would be better to give us more practice on quaternion, subdivision surfaces, materials after splines.
